The database contains 16 tables describing movie rentals to customers. Records in different tables are linked through ids. For example, every record in the 'film' table has a unique 'film_id'. In turn, records in the 'inventory' table are linked to a 'film_id', which can be used to retrieve the full title of the film from the 'film' table. Likewise, each rental event in the 'rental' table is linked to an inventory item through an 'inventory_id' and to a customer through a 'customer_id'. The 'customer_id' value can be used to retreive the first and last names of the renting customer from the 'customer' table. The pattern goes on: each customer has an address_id, each address record has a city_id, and each city record has a country_id. This pattern prevents unnecessary duplication of data, and reduces the chance of errors.

Value counts vary by table. For example, the 'customer' table and 'address' table have very similar value counts, which makes sense. The address count is higher than the customer count by 4 records. The additional records are the 2 store locations and addresses of the 2 staff members. Records that capture historical data are the most numerous, e.g. rentals, which has in excess of 16,000 values. The company has 1000 films and 4581 inventory items, which suggests they hold multiple copies (4.5 average) of each film.
